## Exercise 1: core utils

# basic bash commands

cd
mkdir
rm
rm -r
paste file1 file2 -> combines the content of two files separatet by a tabulator
-d lets you set the separation
-s lets you combine the contents horicontally
expand -t <NR> file -> changes the tabulators of a file to given number of whitespaces
nl file -> number only non empty lines
-b a to number all lines
-s "text" to add a text after the line number
split file -> split file into more files to reduce size
either by bytes [-b] or by lines [-l]
alias NAME=<command> -> used to give a shortname to a command often used
alias -> list all known alias
unalias NAME -> get rid of the named alias
od file -> displays the file in a byte format (default octal)
use -x for hexadecimal, -i for decimal and -c for characters
sort
find
file
wc -> count words
grep -> search for text
seq -> generate seq of number
head, tail -> look at begin, end of a dataset
cat -> does nothing when used with piping
cut -d "sep" -f <NR> file -> cut out the text of the specified field for each line and put it to stdout
less -> pager, lets you easily scroll through the output
more
uniq
diff -> compare two files line by line
colordiff
echo
comm -> older version of diff
ls -> list files
-la um alles anzuzeigen, mit Zugriffsrechten etc
history -> show old commands
search them with strg+r
tee -> output on terminal as well as save to a file
i.e. ls -l / | tee out.file | grep b
use -a to append the file instead of overwrite it
alien -> use to convert installation packages for different distros
chown NEUER_BENUTZER:NEUE_GRUPPE DATEINAME-> change owner and permissions of a file
chgrp -> change group
use -R to change all files/folders ownerships and permissions recursively
whereis
which <command> -> show path where executable was found (only searches paths in PATH variable)
find
locate
df -h -> show information about filesystem size
du -h [directory] -> show size of directory
du -a [directory] -> show size of directory and files
ln -> create link
-s to use symbolic link
ps aux -> list all processes
sudo renice <NR> <PID> -> ändere Prio eines Prozesses
-> Nr von 0 bis 19 (0 höchste Prio)
strg+z -> laufenden command in den hintergrund packen
fg -> im hintergrund laufenden command in den vordergrund holen
man [command] -> manual

# combining Commands

colordiff <(echo hi) <(echo hi2) -> virtual file <()

; -> excute next command after first is finished
| -> pipe
&& -> only continue if first command is successful
& -> program runs in background
<
'>
command << criterion -> launch command until criterion is met
i.e. cat file << EOF -> will print content of file until it reaches EOF (end of file)
i.e. cat file << EOL -> will only print content of file till it reaches the end of a line

The >> appends to a file or creates the file if it doesn't exist.
The > overwrites the file if it exists or creates it if it doesn't exist.
command <(command) -> process substitution, makes the output appear as a file
i.e. diff <(sort file1) file2
Process substitution can also be used to capture output that would normally go to a file, and redirect it to the input of a process.
i.e. tee >(wc -l >&2) < bigfile | gzip > bigfile.gz

1>filename # Redirect stdout to file "filename."
1>>filename # Redirect and append stdout to file "filename."
2>filename # Redirect stderr to file "filename."
2>>filename # Redirect and append stderr to file "filename."
&>filename # Redirect both stdout and stderr to file "filename."
2>&1 # Redirects stderr to stdout. # Error messages get sent to same place as standard output.

# special case:

ls -yz >> command.log 2>&1
#+ Capture result of illegal options "yz" in file "command.log."
#+ Because stderr is redirected to the file,
#+ any error messages will also be there.

#+ Note, however, that the following does _not_ give the same result.
ls -yz 2>&1 >> command.log
#+ Outputs an error message, but does not write to file.
#+ More precisely, the command output (in this case, null)
#+ writes to the file, but the error message goes only to stdout.

#+ If redirecting both stdout and stderr,
#+ the order of the commands makes a difference.

## Exercise 2: combining commands

2 default output channels: stdout, stderr

piping: find -type f | cut -d 4
write: find -type f > out.txt put stdout info into file
find -type f 2> out.txt put debug info into file
less << out.txt

colordiff <(echo hi) <(echo hi2) virtual file <()

## Exercise3:

not for xml and json
good for csv
good for looking at text line by line

## Exercise 4:

less
more

Not print everything to the terminal but just some lines and then let you scroll through it
less can also be used to show the first results if a heavy computation is used

## Exercise 5:

egrep -> shows all files/lines that match the regex

egrep '[a-zA-Z0-9\._+-]+@' mails_match.txt
'' to process stuff with egrep -> bash will not interfer
"" bash interprets some characters by bash -> regex is changed
\ escape for special characters (not needed for - because it was at the end)
--> doesnt work for egrep
[] match 1 character
[]+ match all characters in front
[]\* match none to all characters in front

egrep '^[a-zA-Z0-9\._+-]+@[a-z.]+\.[a-z]+$' mails_match.txt
$ match has to end at the end of line
^ match has to start at the beginning of the line
\. have to escape the dot because it is outside of []

echo '^[a-zA-Z0-9\._+-]+@[a-z.]+\.[a-z]+$' > regex
egrep $(cat regex) mails_match.txt

write regex in file and use it

## Exercise 6:

# part a)

grep -E '.\*' random-mac.txt
matches any character

grep -E '^([0-9A-F]{2}:){5}[0-9A-F]{2}' random-mac.txt
{n} match groups of n characters and captures is
() group regex together

([0-9A-F]{2}:)+ to match 1 or inf appearances of the group

# using python

import re
re.match("^([0-9A-F]{2}:){5}[0-9A-F]{2}\$", "F0:B8:C9:A9:C5:D2")

# part b)

# using perl

cat random-names.txt | perl -n -e'/(.\*)/ && print \$1, "\n"'

read names from the file -> pipe to perl
perl will match regex and gives the result as a group ()
then prints \$1 so the content of the regex to stdout together with a new line

Solution:
cat random-names.txt | perl -n -e'/([a-zA-Z]+) ([a-zA-Z]+)/ && print $2, ", ", $1, "\n"'
group first name and last name separately and captures them and print them in reverse order with a comma between

# Using sed:

cat random-names.txt | sed -E 's/([a-zA-Z]+) ([a-zA-Z]+)/\2, \1/'
match first name and last name as group and print using \2, \1 in reverse order

## Exercise 7:

echo "#FF0000F0" -> rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)

echo "#FF0000F0" | perl -n -e'/#([0-9A-F]{2})([0-9A-F]{2})([0-9A-F]{2})([0-9A-F]{2})/ && print "rgb(", hex($1), ", ", hex($2), ", ", hex($3), ", ", hex($4)/255, ")"'
