## Exercise 1: core utils

sort
find
file
wc -> count words
grep -> search for text
seq -> generate seq of number
head, tail -> look at begin, end of a dataset
cat -> does nothing when used with piping
cut
less -> pager, lets you easily scroll through the output
more
uniq
diff -> compare two files line by line
colordiff
echo
comm -> older version of diff
ls
; -> excute next command after first is finished
| -> pipe
&& -> only continue if first command is successful
& -> program runs in background
<
<<
>>

man [command] -> manual

## Exercise 2: combining commands

2 default output channels: stdout, stderr

piping: find -type f | cut -d 4
write: find -type f > out.txt put stdout info into file
find -type f 2> out.txt put debug info into file
less << out.txt

colordiff <(echo hi) <(echo hi2) virtual file <()

## Exercise3:

not for xml and json
good for csv
good for looking at text line by line

## Exercise 4:

less
more

Not print everything to the terminal but just some lines and then let you scroll through it
less can also be used to show the first results if a heavy computation is used

## Exercise 5:

egrep -> shows all files/lines that match the regex

egrep '[a-zA-Z0-9\._+-]+@' mails_match.txt
'' to process stuff with egrep -> bash will not interfer
"" bash interprets some characters by bash -> regex is changed
\ escape for special characters (not needed for - because it was at the end)
--> doesnt work for egrep
[] match 1 character
[]+ match all characters in front
[]\* match none to all characters in front

egrep '^[a-zA-Z0-9\._+-]+@[a-z.]+\.[a-z]+$' mails_match.txt
$ match has to end at the end of line
^ match has to start at the beginning of the line
\. have to escape the dot because it is outside of []

echo '^[a-zA-Z0-9\._+-]+@[a-z.]+\.[a-z]+$' > regex
egrep $(cat regex) mails_match.txt

write regex in file and use it

## Exercise 6:

# part a)

grep -E '.\*' random-mac.txt
matches any character

grep -E '^([0-9A-F]{2}:){5}[0-9A-F]{2}' random-mac.txt
{n} match groups of n characters and captures is
() group regex together

([0-9A-F]{2}:)+ to match 1 or inf appearances of the group

# using python

import re
re.match("^([0-9A-F]{2}:){5}[0-9A-F]{2}\$", "F0:B8:C9:A9:C5:D2")

# part b)

# using perl

cat random-names.txt | perl -n -e'/(.\*)/ && print \$1, "\n"'

read names from the file -> pipe to perl
perl will match regex and gives the result as a group ()
then prints \$1 so the content of the regex to stdout together with a new line

Solution:
cat random-names.txt | perl -n -e'/([a-zA-Z]+) ([a-zA-Z]+)/ && print $2, ", ", $1, "\n"'
group first name and last name separately and captures them and print them in reverse order with a comma between

# Using sed:

cat random-names.txt | sed -E 's/([a-zA-Z]+) ([a-zA-Z]+)/\2, \1/'
match first name and last name as group and print using \2, \1 in reverse order

## Exercise 7:

echo "#FF0000F0" -> rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)

echo "#FF0000F0" | perl -n -e'/#([0-9A-F]{2})([0-9A-F]{2})([0-9A-F]{2})([0-9A-F]{2})/ && print "rgb(", hex($1), ", ", hex($2), ", ", hex($3), ", ", hex($4)/255, ")"'
